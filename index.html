              Gensim is an open-source library for unsupervised topic modeling, document indexing, retrieval by
              similarity, and other natural language processing functionalities, using modern statistical machine
              learning.

              Gensim is implemented in Python and Cython for performance. Gensim is designed to handle large text
              collections using data streaming and incremental online algorithms, which differentiates it from most
              other machine learning software packages that target only in-memory processing
